# get repository

`git clone git@github.com:evgerritz/amazon-sentiment-analysis.git final`

# before making changes

`git pull origin`
- If this command fails (merge conflicts), call me
- as long as you frequently git pull it shouldn't be a problem

# after making changes

`git add .`
- important: must be in the folder `final`
`git commit -m "[desciption of commit]"`
`git push origin`
